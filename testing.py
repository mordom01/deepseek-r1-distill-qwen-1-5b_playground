So, if I turn on a switch, it will turn on the corresponding light bulb, and vice versa.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase the problem.\n\nWe have three switches and three light bulbs. Each switch is connected to exactly one light bulb. The light bulbs can be on or off. We can turn the switches on or off, but only once, entering the room to observe. We need to determine which switch corresponds to which light bulb.\n\nBut the key is that we can only use one light bulb to determine the state of the switches. So, we can only make one observation, but that observation can give us information about all three switches.\n\nHmm, so we can only see the st corresponding light bulb, and vice versa.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.

So, the challenge is to figure out, based on the state of one lighate of one light bulb after turning on or off the switches. So, the challenge is to figure out, based on the state of one light bulb, which switch is connected to which bulb.\n\nWait, but each switch corresponds to a bulb, so if we can turn on a switch, it will turn on the corresponding bulb. So, if we can manipulate the switches and observe the bulb, we might be able to figu, it will turn on the corresponding bulb. So, if we can manipulate the switches and observe the bulb, we might be able to figure out the correspondence.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the problem says we can only use one light bulb to determine the state of the switches. So, that is, we can only make one observation. So, we can only look at one bulb at a time. So, we can only observe the state of one bulb after potentially turning on or off the switches.\n\nSo, the approach is: we can manipulate the switches (turn them on or off), and then observe the state of one bulb. From that observation, we can deduce the mapping between switches and bulbs.\n\nSo, how can we do this? Let's think about the possible states.\n\nSuppose we have three switches: A, B, C. And three bulbs: 1, 2, 3.\n\nEach switch corresponds to exactly one bulb. So, switch A is connected to bulb 1, switch B to bulb 2, and switch C to bulb 3, or some permutation of that.\n\nWe can turn on switches and observe the bulbs. But we can only make one observation, so we have to figure out a way to use that single bulb's state to deduce all the mappings.\n\nWait, perhaps we can perform a series of operations and then use the bulb's state to deduce the rest.\n\nLet me think.\n\nSuppose we turn on switch A, and then immediately turn it off. Then, we turn on switch B, and turn it off, and so on. But that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a sequence of operations where each operation affects the bulbs in a way that allows us to deduce the mapping based on the bulb's state.\n\nWait, but we can only make one observation. So, perhaps we can perform a series of operations, and then the bulb's state will give us all the information we need.\n\nLet me try an example.\n\nSuppose we have switches A, B, C, and bulbs 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe can perform the following steps:\n\n1"
